This scientific research explores the nature and properties of a lensed gravitational wave signal resulting from compact binary coalescence of merging binary black hole system. In the first part of the research, we focus on the theoretical analysis performed over the past years based on the Takahashi-Nakamura formalism to analytically express the amplification obtained in the source signal due to its encounter with a compact isolated astrophysical lens object. This research presents the results on both wave optics and geometric optics limit and produces an ideal transition point between the two limits for a varying dimensionless frequency of the source signal. We observe that for any value of the dimensionless frequency greater than unity, both the limits hold well and produce similar amount of magnification. In the second part of the research, we produce a sine-gaussian source model and analyze how the source properties are affected by the presence of a point-mass lens model on its way to the observer which results in a strong lensing phenomenon. We see no correlation between the frequency of the sine-gaussian wave and the lensing parameters, but solid correlation between the amplitude of the signal, the source position offset with the lens and lens mass. In the final part of the research, we model a binary black hole merger GW signal and observe how a point-mass lens model would affect the nature and physical parameters of the merging binary black hole system. We see strong correlation between the luminosity distance and lensing parameters. When we create a strongly lensed signal and perform parameter estimation using nested sampling by assuming that there is no lensing, we simulate how LIGO/VIRGO samples any incoming GW signal. We can clearly see that the resulting posteriors of source parameters have huge offset from the originally injected values because of ignoring the lensing effect on the input side. This leads to a conclusion that for GW signals which have higher probability of strong lensing, the interferometers should consider lensing effects while sampling any incoming gravitational wave signal during its observing runs.
